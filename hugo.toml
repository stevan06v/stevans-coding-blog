  bio = 'Hey ðŸ‘‹, I am Stevan Vlajic a software engineer based in Austria. I kinda like coding so I came up with the idea to summarize some programming fundamentals and projects I have worked on in this blog :). Steve Jobs once said: "Weâ€™re here to put a dent in the universe. Otherwise why else even be here?". With that said - have fun using my personal coding blog as a learning resource and put a dent in the universe I guess ;)!'
